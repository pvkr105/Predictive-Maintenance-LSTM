# Predictive-Maintenance-LSTM
In this notebook, we build an LSTM network for the data set and scenerio described at Predictive Maintenance Template to predict remaining useful life of aircraft engines. In summary, the template uses simulated aircraft sensor values to predict when an aircraft engine will fail in the future so that maintenance can be planned in advance.
